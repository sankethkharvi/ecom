    Niveus Solutions Pvt. Ltd. is a boot-strapped cloud engineering services organization founded by Suyog Shetty, Rashmi George, Roshan Bava, and Mohsin Khan in Karnataka, India. The roots of Niveus were sown in 2013 when the 4 founders, who come with rich experience working with companies such as Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, and Sapient, realized they shared a common dream of building a world-class cloud engineering services company. The immense talent pool available in nearby education hubs Udupi, Manipal, and Mangalore, from where some of the country’s and the world’s brightest minds hail, convinced the Founders that their dream could turn into a reality. Niveus progressed rapidly over the years with the company making a strategic decision in 2019 to exclusively partner with Google Cloud India and winning the ‘Breakthrough Partner of the Year – Asia Pacific’ award for 2020. The company now operates in multiple cities including Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, and Singapore.
